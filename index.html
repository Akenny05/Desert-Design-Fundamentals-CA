        <h2><h2>Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador[1] and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.</h2>
